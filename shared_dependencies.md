To generate code for Python, Swift, and C#, we need to identify the shared dependencies. Here are the names of the shared dependencies that might be common across these files:

1. Exported Variables:
   - `appVersion`
   - `appName`
   - `userSession`

2. Data Schemas:
   - `User` (with fields like `id`, `name`, `email`)
   - `Product` (with fields like `productId`, `productName`, `price`)

3. ID Names of DOM Elements (for potential web interface in Python using frameworks like Flask or Django):
   - `loginButton`
   - `signupForm`
   - `productList`
   - `userProfile`

4. Message Names (for logging or inter-process communication):
   - `UserLoggedIn`
   - `UserLoggedOut`
   - `ProductAdded`
   - `ProductRemoved`

5. Function Names:
   - `initializeApp`
   - `authenticateUser`
   - `fetchProducts`
   - `addProductToCart`
   - `removeProductFromCart`

These names are placeholders and would be used consistently across the Python, Swift, and C# code to ensure that the different parts of the application can interoperate and that the code is maintainable.
